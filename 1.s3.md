# Case Study: Optimizing Data Transfer Costs through Mascot File Size Reduction

## Problem Statement:
 When serving 100 customers using our current tech-stack, we will be experiencing high AWS S3 data transfer costs due to the large size of our mascot images, resulting in an anticipated annual expense of $500,000. To reduce these costs while maintaining mascot quality, we will explore solutions such as compression techniques and transitioning to vector animations like SVG.

## Introduction:
One significant cost driver will be the data transfer cost incurred through Amazon S3 for delivering mascot images to approximately 100 customers. The anticipated annual cost will be $500,000, posing a significant financial challenge for our organization.

## Problem Analysis:

### Current Situation:

- **Data Transfer Volume:** We will serve approximately 100 customers, resulting in 620 million requests per month.
- **Average Mascot Image Size:** The average size of our mascot image is 1.5 MB.
- **Current Cost:** We are incurring a data transfer cost of $500,000 annually, primarily due to the high volume of mascot transfers.

### Financial Implications:

The anticipated $500,000 annual data transfer cost will have a direct impact on our bottom line and profitability. This cost will be unsustainable in the long run and must be reduced while ensuring that the quality of our mascot images is maintained to meet customer expectations.

## Proposed Solutions:

To address the challenge of reducing data transfer costs while maintaining mascot image quality, we will consider the following potential solutions:

### 1. Compression Techniques:

We will implement compression techniques, such as gzip, on our mascot images, significantly reducing their file size while preserving image quality. This approach can be applied to both existing and future mascot images, allowing us to benefit from reduced data transfer costs.

### 2. Transition to Vector Animations (SVG):

Vector animations, represented by SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files, will offer a highly efficient way to reduce file sizes while ensuring high image quality. SVG files are resolution-independent and can be scaled without loss of quality. By converting our mascot images to SVG format, we will achieve substantial reductions in data transfer costs.

## Expected Outcomes:

### Cost Reduction:

- **Current Cost:** $500,000 per year
- **Projected Cost Reduction:** By reducing the mascot image size from 1.5 MB to 15 KB, the annual AWS Data Transfer cost is expected to decrease to $5,000. This will represent a remarkable cost reduction of $495,000 per year.

### Improved Efficiency:

Implementing compression and transitioning to SVG files will not only reduce costs but will also improve the efficiency of data transfer processes. Smaller files will lead to faster load times for customers, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Quality Maintenance:

Careful implementation of compression and SVG conversion will ensure that mascot image quality remains at a high standard, meeting customer expectations and preserving our brand image.

## Implementation Plan:

We will proceed with the following steps to implement the proposed solutions:

1. **Image Compression:** The IT team will implement compression techniques (e.g., gzip) on existing mascot images and develop a process for applying compression to new images before they are uploaded to AWS S3.

2. **SVG Conversion:** Graphic designers will work on converting mascot images to SVG format while ensuring that the quality is maintained. This process will be gradually applied to all mascot images in the content library.

3. **Testing and Monitoring:** After implementation, we will closely monitor the impact on data transfer costs and user experience. Any issues related to image quality or performance will be addressed promptly.

## Conclusion:

By addressing the challenge of high AWS S3 data transfer costs, we will significantly reduce our annual expenses, improving our overall financial health. Implementing compression techniques and transitioning to SVG files will offer viable solutions to achieve this goal while maintaining mascot image quality and enhancing customer satisfaction. This strategic approach will align with our commitment to cost optimization and efficiency in our operations.
