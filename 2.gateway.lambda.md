# Case Study: Future-Proofing API Gateway and Lambda for Mascot Delivery

## Introduction:

**Scenario:** API Gateway + Lambda

**Projected Request Volume:** In the near future, we anticipate the need for serving a substantial volume of 40 million requests per day to serve mascots to about 100 customers (each serve request needs to send at least 2 requests, one for serving the mascot, and one for sending serve information to our database) .

**Assumption:** To accommodate potential database (DB) calls and network interactions, we anticipate a conservative estimate of 2 seconds for AWS Lambda code execution time. While we acknowledge the existence of methods to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, it's important to note that managed services, in theory, offer infinitely scalable solutions, which, if not managed carefully, could have significant financial implications for our organization.



## Problem Analysis:

### Current Projected Costs:

As we look ahead, we anticipate the following projected costs for our API Gateway and AWS Lambda services:

- **API Gateway:** The current projection estimates a monthly cost of $3.5k, which amounts to $42k annually.

- **AWS Lambda:** Similarly, the current projection estimates a monthly cost of $42k, resulting in an annual cost of about $500k.

## Financial Implications:

The financial implications of these cost projections are significant. Without intervention, the projected costs for our API Gateway and AWS Lambda services will impose a substantial burden on our budget. This could hinder our ability to allocate resources for other essential aspects of our operations and strategic initiatives.

## Proposed Solutions:

In light of the upcoming challenges and cost projections, we have explored potential solutions to optimize our infrastructure for serving mascot images. We aim to ensure that our infrastructure remains both cost-effective and scalable as we continue to grow.

### Solution: Implementing NGINX and Building a Custom Gateway

**Rationale:** To address the anticipated increase in request volume and the associated cost challenges, we have identified the implementation of NGINX and the development of our own API Gateway as a promising solution.

**Benefits:** By opting for this approach, we expect to achieve the following advantages:

1. **Cost Efficiency:** The primary benefit lies in the significant reduction of operational costs. Our expenses will be limited to the utilization of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) virtual machines (VMs) to host NGINX. This cost-efficient approach is expected to provide substantial savings compared to the current API Gateway and Lambda costs.

2. **Scalability:** Building our custom Gateway based on NGINX provides us with greater control and flexibility over our infrastructure. This enables us to scale resources as needed to meet the growing demand for mascot delivery.

3. **Customization:** With a custom Gateway, we gain the ability to tailor our infrastructure to the specific needs of our mascot delivery service. This includes optimizing the routing and processing of requests, enhancing security measures, and fine-tuning performance.

## Expected Outcomes:

### Cost Reduction:

By implementing the NGINX-based custom Gateway, we anticipate a significant reduction in our annual infrastructure costs. The shift from the current API Gateway and AWS Lambda setup to our cost-efficient solution is projected to result in substantial savings, improving our budgetary efficiency.

### Enhanced Scalability:

The custom Gateway based on NGINX offers us the scalability needed to accommodate the projected increase in request volume. As we continue to grow, this solution allows us to seamlessly expand our infrastructure without constraints.

### Performance Optimization:

Our ability to customize and fine-tune the custom Gateway will lead to improved overall performance. This ensures that we can continue to deliver mascot images efficiently and reliably to our customers.

## Implementation Plan:

To bring this solution to fruition, we have devised a comprehensive implementation plan that outlines the steps and milestones for a successful transition.

1. **NGINX Integration:** In the near future, we will integrate NGINX into our infrastructure. This will involve setting up EC2 instances to host NGINX and configuring it to act as a reverse proxy for managing incoming requests.

2. **API Gateway Transition:** Concurrently, we will plan and execute a transition from our current API Gateway to the NGINX-based custom Gateway. This transition will include route migration and the establishment of comprehensive monitoring and logging.

3. **Transitioning Away From Lambda:** As part of the transition, we will adjust our Lambda functions to work seamlessly with the custom Gateway. This will ensure a smooth transition without any disruptions to our mascot serve and track service.

4. **Performance Optimization:** Our team will continuously monitor and optimize the performance of the custom Gateway to maintain efficient and reliable service.

5. **Cost Monitoring:** We will closely track the cost savings achieved through this solution and make adjustments as necessary to maximize cost efficiency.

## Conclusion:

By proactively addressing the impending challenges and anticipating the need for scalability and cost control, we are well-prepared to navigate the future landscape of serving mascot images to our customers. The implementation of NGINX and the development of our own API Gateway present an opportunity for us to not only reduce costs but also enhance our infrastructure's performance and customization capabilities.
