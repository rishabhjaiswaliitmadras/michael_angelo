# Case Study: Optimization of Amazon DynamoDB Writes

## Problem Statement:

**Anticipated Issue:** We are projecting an increase in write operations on Amazon DynamoDB, particularly in a write-heavy use case.

**Annual Cost:** The anticipated annual cost of Amazon DynamoDB usage is expected to reach $40,000.

## Proposed Solutions:

To address the projected challenge of excessive DynamoDB writes and optimize our infrastructure, we propose the following solutions:

### 1. Write Optimization:

Given the anticipated write-heavy nature of our use case, we will optimize our write operations to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. Key aspects of this approach include:

- **Enhanced `id` Column:** Instead of creating a separate column, we will enhance the `id` column by composing it as `epoch_time + userId + randomUUID`. This composite key is projected to minimize the need for additional writes associated with index creation, thus optimizing our write operations, because we can employ the query operation instead of the scan operation, and the query operation significantly outperforms the scan operation in terms of speed and efficiency.





### 2. Data Retention Strategy:

To effectively manage the projected volume of data stored in DynamoDB, we will implement a data retention strategy. This strategy encompasses:

- **Limited Records:** We will project retaining only the most recent and relevant 1 million records in DynamoDB. This limit is expected to help keep DynamoDB lean and cost-efficient.

- **TTL (Time-to-Live) for Older Data:** Records that are no longer actively used or needed will have a TTL applied, typically set to 3 to 4 days. When the TTL expires, these older records will be automatically moved to more cost-effective storage, such as Amazon S3 cold storage.

## Expected Outcomes:

### Cost Reduction:

These solutions are expected to lead to a significant reduction in our projected annual Amazon DynamoDB costs. By optimizing write operations and implementing a data retention strategy, we anticipate achieving cost savings while maintaining data accessibility.

### Operational Efficiency:

Projected optimization of write operations will result in improved operational efficiency, reduced resource utilization, and smoother data management processes.

### Data Accessibility:

While older data is projected to be archived in S3 cold storage, it will remain accessible for retrieval when necessary. This ensures data integrity and compliance with data retention requirements.

## Implementation Plan:

To execute these solutions effectively, we will follow a structured implementation plan:

1. **Write Optimization Implementation:** We will prioritize the implementation of the enhanced `id` column in our write operations. This involves code modifications and thorough testing to ensure seamless integration with our existing systems.

2. **Data Retention Strategy Deployment:** Concurrently, we will project the data retention strategy into action. This includes defining criteria for data retention and archiving, as well as developing automated processes for transitioning data to S3 cold storage.

3. **Monitoring and Adjustment:** Following implementation, we will closely monitor DynamoDB usage, projected costs, and performance. Any adjustments will be made to optimize the system for sustained cost efficiency.

## Conclusion:

By proactively addressing the challenge of excessive DynamoDB writes, we aim to achieve substantial projected cost savings while maintaining data accessibility and operational efficiency. These strategies align with our commitment to optimizing infrastructure and data management practices.
