# Optimizing Route 53 Configuration for Future Cost Efficiency

## Current Architecture:

Our current Route 53 architecture is performing well, and we plan to retain it. We can efficiently handle 620 Standard queries.

## Approach to Optimization:

To further enhance cost efficiency while maintaining satisfactory performance, we are considering specific trade-offs that prioritize cost savings over minimal latency. Our approach includes the following adjustments:

1. **Avoidance of Specific Query Types:**

   - **Latency Based Routing Queries:** These queries direct traffic to the AWS region with the lowest latency for end users. In the future, we will avoid using this routing method in favor of cost savings.

   - **Geo DNS Queries:** Geo DNS queries rely on the geographic location of DNS resolvers to determine the appropriate DNS record to return. We will refrain from using this method to achieve cost efficiency.

   - **IP-Based Routing Queries:** Future configurations will not make use of IP-based routing queries to simplify our setup.

   - **IP (CIDR) Blocks:** We will avoid employing IP (CIDR) blocks for routing decisions, as they can introduce unnecessary complexity.

   - **DNS Failover Health Checks for Endpoints:** While DNS Failover Health Checks are valuable for ensuring high availability, we will avoid their implementation to streamline our setup and reduce costs.

2. **Traffic Flow Simplification:**

   - In the future, we will strive to maintain a straightforward Route 53 configuration and avoid overly complex Traffic Flow settings that might introduce unnecessary costs and complexity.

## Definition of Standard Queries:

**Standard queries** refer to typical DNS queries that resolve domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. These queries are fundamental in the DNS (Domain Name System) and are used for everyday web browsing and accessing various online services. They are characterized by their simplicity and efficiency in translating user-friendly domain names (e.g., example.com) into numerical IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1), allowing computers to locate and connect to web servers on the internet.
