# Summary: Cost Optimization Initiatives

In this series of case studies, we have identified cost optimization opportunities in various aspects of our infrastructure and proposed solutions to reduce expenses while maintaining or improving performance. Here's a summary of the cost impact before and after implementing the proposed solutions:

## Optimizing Data Transfer Costs through Mascot File Size Reduction
- **Current Cost:** $500,000 per year
- **Projected Cost Reduction:** By reducing mascot image size from 1.5 MB to 15 KB, the annual AWS Data Transfer cost is expected to decrease to $5,000.
- **Cost Reduction:** $495,000 per year
- **Outcome:** Significant cost reduction while improving data transfer efficiency and maintaining mascot image quality.
- **DETAILED DISCUSSION:** https://github.com/orgs/chateleon/discussions/19

## Future-Proofing API Gateway and Lambda for Mascot Delivery
- **Current API Gateway Cost:** $42,000 per year
- **Current AWS Lambda Cost:** $500,000 per year
- **Projected Cost Reduction:** Implementing NGINX and building a custom Gateway is expected to result in substantial savings.
- **Outcome:** Improved cost efficiency, scalability, and performance in serving mascot images while controlling infrastructure expenses.

## Optimization of Amazon DynamoDB Writes
- **Anticipated Annual Cost:** $40,000
- **Projected Cost Reduction:** Implementing write optimizations and a data retention strategy is expected to reduce DynamoDB costs significantly.
- **Outcome:** Cost savings, operational efficiency, and data accessibility improvements in DynamoDB operations.

## Optimizing CDN Costs: Leveraging Price Class for AWS CloudFront
- **US/EU/Israel Cost:** $500,000 per PB per year 
- **India Cost:** $1.02 million per PB per year 
- **Potential Savings:** Significant cost savings by implementing "Price Class 100" for AWS CDN.
- **Outcome:** Reduced CDN expenses without compromising content delivery quality.

## Optimizing Route 53 Configuration for Future Cost Efficiency
- **Current Configuration:** Handling 620 million Standard queries per month costs around $250 a month.
- **Approach:** Avoiding specific query types and simplifying Traffic Flow settings for cost savings.
- **Outcome:** Enhanced cost efficiency in DNS services while maintaining satisfactory performance.

By implementing these cost optimization initiatives, we aim to significantly reduce operational expenses across various infrastructure components while ensuring high-quality services. These efforts align with our commitment to cost optimization, operational efficiency, and long-term financial sustainability.
